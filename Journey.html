        JOURNEY
      </h1>
      <div class="aboutMeText">
        <p>
          Bronagh’s yoga journey began in 2013 when she attended her first yoga class. She stepped onto her mat with an open heart, 
          unaware of the influence it would have on her existence. Yoga has been a guide in Bronagh’s life. As her yoga practice deepened, 
          she noticed a significant change in her being. Her mindset and perspective shifted; she learned to differentiate between societal 
          conditioning and her true essence. Bronagh’s evolved outlook allows her to observe the world from an alternative perspective, 
          where she has learned to heal herself and those around her.

      <h3>TEACHING</h3>
    </span>
      <p>
        As a qualified yoga teacher, Bronagh has trained in a multitude of styles: Hatha, Vinyasa, Yinish, Yoga through the 5 elements, and Nidra. 
        She has completed a total of 500 hours EYRT in India and has taught globally to students of all levels. Her understanding of the balance 
        between Yin and Yang shines through each of her flows. Her Yang sequences combine elements of Hatha and Vinyasa to strengthen and open the 
        body to make room for growth. Whilst her Yin sequences aim to release tension to reset and heal the body and mind, 
        through Yinish flows, Nidra and Shakti Circles aligning with the lunar cycle. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bronagh has been teaching for over two years. To remain faithful to her ethos, she runs a variety of classes, both in-person and online. 
      She also teaches privately, from one to one sessions to small groups.
      When in the UK, Bronagh has dedicated a significant amount of time to a local charity: The DASH (Domestic Abuse Stops Here) Charity. 
      Whilst working as a support worker empowering survivors of domestic abuse, she was given the opportunity to teach yoga to those in the refuge. 
      In doing so, she created a safe space to aid their recovery and guide their healing process.

  <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
</span>
<p>
  Bronagh attained a Bachelor’s Degree in Philosophy from Cardiff University. Her education facilitated her discovery of eastern spirituality and 
  allowed her to explore and develop her belief system. Her continual desire for growth ensures that she can appreciate and understand the roots 
  of yoga in combination with its modern variations. Her yoga classes encompass her passions and skills. She often intertwines dance and yoga to 
  create intricate and fluid sequences for her classes. 
  She incorporates Tarot, Hindu Mythology, Philosophy, and ritual into her class structures to deepen her student's practice.
</p>
        <p>
          Bronagh grew up just outside of London but spends a lot of time traveling the world to grow as both a student & teacher. 
          Immersing herself in a natural environment is part of her daily routine reminding her to remain grounded and to connect with the divine. 
          Bronagh intends to share what she has learned from yoga with her students. To heal, to release, and to grow.
